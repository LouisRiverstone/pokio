**Pokio** is a modern asynchronous library for PHP, built to bring concurrent programming to your codebase. It allows you to run multiple tasks in parallel, making it easier to handle and manage concurrent operations.

> Note: Pokio is still under active development and is not yet ready for production use.

## Installation

> **Requires [PHP 8.4+](https://php.net/releases/)**

Pokio relies on the **pcntl** and **posix** extensions for the asynchronous process handling. If these extensions are not available you can still use Pokio, but it will run in synchronous mode.

<!-- TODO: Add Composer installation after packagist release -->
